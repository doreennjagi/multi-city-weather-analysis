## 🔹 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Collect real-time weather metrics (temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather description) for multiple cities and derive actionable insights.  
- **Cities Tracked:** Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu (expandable to more).  
- **Data Collection Method:** Python `requests` library with OpenWeatherMap API.  
- **Visualization Tools:** Interactive plots using Plotly.

## 🔹 Analytics & Insights

From the collected weather data:

| City    | Average Temperature (°C) | Average Humidity (%) | Weather Trend        |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Nairobi | 23.5                     | 68                 | Moderate and balanced |
| Mombasa | 27.2                     | 72                 | Hotter and humid    |
| Kisumu  | 24.1                     | 70                 | Balanced profile    |

**Key Observations:**
- 🌡️ **Temperature:** Nairobi remains moderate, Mombasa is consistently hotter.  
- 💧 **Humidity:** Mombasa has higher humidity compared to Nairobi and Kisumu.  
- 💨 **Wind Speed:** Kisumu experiences mild and consistent wind speeds.  
- 📝 **Overall:** Weather patterns differ by city, and these trends can be useful for travel planning, agriculture, or urban climate analysis.
